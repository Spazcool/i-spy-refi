# UNH Boot Camp Project 2 Proposal

## Project Name
Tamagotchi (Working Title)

## Project Description
In a few sentences, describe the following:
    -The audience is anyone who needs an electronic pet because they can't have a
     real one and anyone who wants to be entertained by a little electronic friend.
    -Ultimately, Tamagotchi comforts and entertain users by providing interaction
     and care-taking the digital creature. 
    -To use Tamagotchi, users need to log into the app, set up their Tamagotchi's
     information upon first use (name, birthday), then care for their Tamagotchi 
     by feeding it, cleaning it, playing with/loving it, 
     putting it to bed, keeping it warm. If user fails to do these activities,
      Tamagotchi will get sicker and sicker until it dies.
    -(Not MVP - users could potentially customize their creature a little 
    ex.colors)

## Communication Considerations
- How often will you hold meetings? 
    - M, T, W, Th F, Sa 
- How will you keep track of tasks? 
    -GitHub Projects, Google Docs (meeting tracking), code review
- What if someone misses a deadline?
    -They will state where they are struggling so the rest of the team can support
     and problem solve a work around if needed.
- What happens if someone misses a meeting? What is their responsibility? What is
 the team's responsibility?
    -They need to notify the team prior to the meeting that they can't make it or
     will be late and will still be responsible for their tasks. Failure to comply
    will result in the team member's exclusion (<- is this allowed?).
- What if there is friction between members? How will you address it?
    -Talk through it constructively (or hug it out)
