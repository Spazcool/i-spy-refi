# UNH Boot Camp Project 3 Proposal

## Project Name
i-Spy a Refi

## Project Description

### House Refinance/Sales Comparison Calculator:
Refianance calculator that compares potential value with recently sold houses of similiar traits.

#### Business Need:
* a lot of real estate apps/sites offer a comparison calculator but it uses a single factor (i.e. they're only comparing the total cash value of the properties being compared).
* Such a tool allows the user to roughly appraise their house so they have an idea of what they're going to see when a bank does the same for a loan/refinance
* However, being singled-factored, limits the usefulness of the comparisons offered on other sites/apps; houses of value X are being compared to plots of land of value X, for example

#### Our Solution: 
* expand upon the above by making it a multi-factor comparison (e.g. price, area, style of house, crime stats, etcâ€¦)
* comparing across multiple recently sold homes in the area
* saving those comparisons over time to spot trends
* export functionality for sharing
* HELOC calculator (EXTRA)

## Communication Considerations
- How often will you hold meetings? 
    - M, T, W, Th F, Sa 
- How will you keep track of tasks? 
    -GitHub Projects, Google Docs (meeting tracking), code review
- What if someone misses a deadline?
    -They will state where they are struggling so the rest of the team can support
     and problem solve a work around if needed.
- What happens if someone misses a meeting? What is their responsibility? What is
 the team's responsibility?
    -They need to notify the team prior to the meeting that they can't make it or
     will be late and will still be responsible for their tasks. Failure to comply will result in sitting in the naughty corner.
- What if there is friction between members? How will you address it?
    -Talk through it constructively (or hug it out)
